            <p>Hello eveyone! here's a little bit of information about me: I'm from
                Mexico and I'm 29 years old. I enjoy listening to music, especially from
                past decades (70's, 80's, and 90's), but I also like listening to modern music. 
                Additonally, I really like sci-fi, so I'm always happy to recommend films, 
                books and tv-shows!
            </p>

            <h2>Toluca, Mexico State</h2>
            <img src="images/cosmovitral.jpeg" alt="The Cosmovitral located at Toluca, Mexico State">
            <p>Toluca is the city where I live, and its located in Mexico State, very near to Mexico City.
                 The cosmovrital is a botanical garden housed in a former market building. 
                 It is famous for its massive stained-glass mural, created by artist Leopoldo Flores. The mural, one of the largest of its kind in the world, 
                 represents the evolution of life, combining themes of nature, science, and the cosmos. </p>
